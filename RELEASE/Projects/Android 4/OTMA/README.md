OTMA

OTMA game

The setting is a kind of labyrinth building where a player has to find his/her way (like in many shootergames).
The assignment is to find six  (or this number might adaptable) hints to come well prepared to the OTMA.
Also (s)he has to encounter the OTMA faculty and organisers (six persons - some avatar with picture or lookalike drawing) who wander around in the labyrinth.
And the player needs to become acquainted with OTM (content of various conferences and workshops) by visiting six rooms.

At the entrance of the OTM building the player can see the registration desk (with DaniÃ«l and Jan) and get the information to play the game from them.
(s)he might have to register ? Or receive a kind of registration card.
Also there is some hall of fame (with scores and timings from earlier players).

When wandering around the player comes across doors that can open. Each door has a logo on it.
Some doors don't open, but the ones that do have the logo (or name) of an OTM conference or workshop.
Once inside, the player receives some information (conference topics) on the workshop or conference concerned. [= goal 1]
Also inside, (s)he can see other things: or someone is giving a presentation, or a coffee break is announced, or a session chair apologises for a change in the schedule, etc.
This is a random loop of events. Only if a presentation is being given, the presentation concerns a hint to prepare well the OTMA paper, poster or presentation. There can be many hints that are also scheduled in some loop.
So if a player decides to stay in the room, after a while (s)he will have 6 different hints [= goal 2] - but it will take some time.

The six OTMA avatars also wander around in the building - albeit a bit slower so that a player can catch up with them.
When this happens the avatar introduces him/her and his/her role in the OTMA. [= goal 3]

Only when the player has achieved all goals [= well prepared for the OTMA], (s)he can open the OTMA door and enter.
There, all the advantages of a participation in the OTMA are shown (e.g. Springer publication, coaching, cheaper price etc.) and the player can enter his/her email address to receive the complete call for papers.

Of course, there can be some obstacle. It could be the conference bar or hotel pool or beach, where a player is "stuck" for some time. 
Another obstacle could be that a player might have suddenly lost his registration card so no door at all opens anymore.
Alternatively some good avatars can be wandering around as well (Robert ;-)) who provide him/her with a new registration card (otherwise the player has to go back to the entrance/registration desk) or who "frees" the player from the bar etc.

This is a single player mode, but when thinking of a multiplayer mode one could imagine that only one player at a time can enter a room.
Or that players cannot overtake one another in a corridor (and hence can block each other). Or bad promoters can take away their hints.
Or the corridor is (temporarily) blocked by people having a break or chatting ...
