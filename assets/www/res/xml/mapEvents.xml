<!-- All global map events go here. Other events for the different levels are

	 An event has an id as sole attribute with which it can be referenced by an
	 event trigger/npc/teleport. An event can have an arbitrary number of
	 actions. For examples on different actions see the already existing events
	 in this file. Their use should be self-explanatory. Below are also some
	 examples (commented out) on how to use talkevent modes. See also
